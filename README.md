# SnakeGame

A neural networks based snake game.

Relies on:
1. Tensorflow
2. TFLearn
3. PyGame
4. NumPy

Make sure you have the above dependencies, otherwise install them using ```pip install [dependency]```

**How to run:**

```
source bin/activate
python SnakeGame.py
```

Written entirely in Python, it was a good project to practice python and get good practice on TFLearn and Neural Networks in general.
