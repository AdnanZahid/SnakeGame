# SnakeGame

**SnakeGame** is an AI-driven version of the classic Snake game, utilizing neural networks to enhance gameplay intelligence.

## Dependencies

Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

- **TensorFlow**: Machine learning framework
- **TFLearn**: High-level deep learning library built on TensorFlow
- **PyGame**: Set of Python modules for game development
- **NumPy**: Library for numerical computations

Install any missing dependencies using:

```bash
pip install tensorflow tflearn pygame numpy
```

## How to run
Activate virtual environment:

```bash
source bin/activate
```

## Execute the game:

```bash
python SnakeGame.py
```

## Objective
This project serves as a practical exercise in Python programming, offering hands-on experience with TFLearn and neural networks.
